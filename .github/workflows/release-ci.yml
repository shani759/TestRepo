            **‚ö†Ô∏è AUTOMATIC BLOCK TRIGGERED**
            
            ### Details
            - **Branch:** `${{ github.ref_name }}`
            - **Cutoff Date:** `${{ steps.cutoff.outputs.cutoff }}`
            - **Commit Date:** `$(git show -s --format=%cd --date=format:%Y-%m-%d ${{ github.sha }})`
            - **Commit SHA:** `${{ github.sha }}`
            - **Author:** `@${{ github.actor }}`
            - **Triggered by:** [Workflow Run #${{ github.run_number }}](${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }})
            
            ### What Happened?
            A commit was made on `$(git show -s --format=%cd --date=format:%Y-%m-%d ${{ github.sha }})` and pushed to release branch `${{ github.ref_name }}` after the established cutoff date of **${{ steps.cutoff.outputs.cutoff }}**.
            
            The CI/CD pipeline has been **automatically blocked** to prevent uncontrolled changes to this release.
            
            ### Required Actions
            - [ ] **Review the urgency** of this commit with the release manager
            - [ ] **Get approval** from stakeholders for post-cutoff changes
            - [ ] **Verify impact** on release timeline and stability
            - [ ] **Update cutoff date** in `.release_config.yml` if needed (emergency only)
            - [ ] **Close this issue** once resolved
            
            ### Emergency Override
            If this is a critical hotfix, update the cutoff date in `.release_config.yml`:
            ```yaml
            releases:
              ${{ github.ref_name }}:
                cutoff: "NEW_DATE_HERE"  # Format: YYYY-MM-DD
            ```
